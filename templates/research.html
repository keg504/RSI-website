                <h4>Laptop Cystoscope</h4>
                <p>RSI won the BIRAC-BIG award from the Indian Government for working on the Laptop Cystoscope with SINE-IIT Bombay. Surveys show that even in remote areas, about 5% of outpatients have Urology problems. More than half of them could be managed with just a Cystoscope that is used for diagnosis and for minor first stage procedures. However, at present, less than 2% of the Urology patients can get the necessary treatment in rural areas because non â€“ Urologists are unable to afford the conventional Cystoscope and the accessory equipment like the camera, light source and others that are necessary for Cystoscopy.</p>
                <p>The Laptop Cystoscope costs about one twentieth of the conventional Cystoscopy setup as it can be connected to the Laptop to perform diagnostic and other procedures. Controlled trials are going on at Medical Colleges and rural hospitals for validation.</p>

                <h4>Gas Insufflation Less Laparoscopic Surgeries</h4>
                <p>RSI is also involved with promoting Gas Insufflation Less Laparoscopic Surgeries [GILLS] along with IFRS and others. GILLS makes laparoscopic surgery possible in rural areas under the less expensive and easily available spinal anesthesia. RSI is currently working on the hand instruments and low-cost camera for GILLS.</p>
